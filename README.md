# Foreword

Please be aware that any modification to your gateway, in particular a modification of U-Boot, may permanently brick
your device and is not covered by warranty.

# Compiling the Software

## Obtaining the Source Code

The source code of this project is maintained with git.

```
git clone --recurse-submodules <repository>
cd smart-garden-gateway-public
```
Optionally, specific versions can be checked out (7.8.1 in this case):
```bash
git checkout release/linux-system-7.8.1
```

Older versions of the build system can be found in the history. However, only for the most recent master we intend to
ensure that the build works.

Source code packages for all distributed versions can be found [here](https://opensource.smart.gardena.dev/gateway/index.html).

## Prerequisites

# Getting access

On both versions of the gateway, the UART port can be found on J7. Settings are 115200 8N1, the level is 3.3V.

Once connected, simply follow the instructions printed during startup.

Alternatively, right after powering up a gateway, pressing the 'X' key will grant access to the U-Boot shell.

# Flashing

## Installing a Custom Image

The easiest way to install a self-built kernel and rootfs is to fetch the images over the network from within U-Boot,
using TFTP.

Ideally, the TFTP server (e.g. [tftp-hpa](https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/network/tftp/tftp-hpa.git)) and the DHCP server
(e.g. [dnsmasq](https://thekelleys.org.uk/dnsmasq/doc.html)) run on the same machine, allowing the following steps to
work:

- Select the other boot slot: `run do_toggle_bootslot`
- Prevent "updates" to proprietary image: `env set update_url updates-disabled`
  (run `env set update_url && env save` to re-enable updates)
- Write environment to flash storage: `env save`
- Fetch kernel and rootfs over TFTP and write it to flash storage:

  ```
  ubi part nand
  dhcp fitImage-gardena-sg-mt7688.bin && ubi write ${fileaddr} kernel${bootslot} ${filesize}
  dhcp gardena-image-foss-bnw-gardena-sg-mt7688.squashfs-xz && ubi write ${fileaddr} rootfs${bootslot} ${filesize}
  ```

  **Article Number 19000 (Atmel AT91SAM)**
  ```
  ubi part ubi
  dhcp fitImage-gardena-sg-at91sam.bin && ubi write ${fileaddr} kernel${bootslot} ${filesize}
  dhcp gardena-image-foss-bnw-gardena-sg-at91sam.squashfs-xz && ubi write ${fileaddr} rootfs${bootslot} ${filesize}
  ```
- Restart the gateway: `reset`

## Adding the Proprietary Bits

It is possible to install the proprietary packages via OPKG by doing the following in the Linux shell:
- Update the OPKG feeds: `opkg update`
- Install the packages:
  ```bash
  opkg install \
      accessory-server \
      cloudadapter \
      fwrolloutd \
      gateway-config-backend \
      gateway-config-frontend \
      lemonbeatd \
      lwm2mserver
  ```
- Reboot gateway: `reboot`

> **Note**:
> The read-write filesystem is (currently) not large enough to contain all the above packages. It is possible to resize
> the UBI volumes. However, that must be done with great care.
